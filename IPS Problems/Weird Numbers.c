/*Question:
Given an integer, n, perform the following conditional actions:

If  n is odd, print Weird

If  n is even and in the inclusive range of  2 to 5, print Not Weird (2,3,4,5)

If  n is even and in the inclusive range of  6 to 20, print Weird (6,7,â€¦,19,20)

If  n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird (21, 22..)*/

//Code:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    if (n % 2 != 0) {
        printf("Weird");
    }
    else {
        if (n >= 2 && n <= 5) {
            printf("Not Weird");
        }
        else if (n >= 6 && n <= 20) {
            printf("Weird");
        }
        else {
            printf("Not Weird");
        }
    }
    return 0;
